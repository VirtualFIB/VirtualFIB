# liftout-animator
Blender application template to animate in-situ liftout.

## How to run

Download .zip and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/). This version has been built on Blender 2.91.0.

Install and run Blender, then click the blender icon in the top left toolbar and select Install Application Template

Select the downloaded .zip and install. Restart Blender and on the splashscreen select 'Liftout Animator'. Alternatively, in an open Blender window, select File>New>Liftout Animator

## Fork and modify

The whole repo can be cloned into the right location, see link to documentation on where to find it below. On windows, if you've previously installed application templates (on a new system, just install it like described above first so Blender automatically creates the folders) navigate to 'Username'/AppData/Roaming/Blender Foundation/Blender/'version'/scripts/startup/bl_app_templates_user.
